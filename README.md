# ship_data_verification

Increasing the resilience of MASS remote pilotâ€™s situational awareness using land-based sensors. This repository presents an application of interval-based fault detection on experimental data to illustrate the interest of land-based sensors for the validation of the data broadcasted by a remotely operated ship.

## Description

*tube_fault_detection.py* : main script, detect the falsification of the ship data

*tube_trajectory_falsification.py* : falsify the boat trajectory of the ship perspective

*tube_trajectory_generation.py* : extract the dataset series and create the estimation trajectory and tubes

## Dependencies 

Pandas, Codac, Numpy and Pyplot
